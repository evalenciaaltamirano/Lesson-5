# Lesson-5 Is now where it starts to get coding friendly but this LESSON is all about having a good understanding in who will be the ones visiting your website who the type of audicience you will be having. Also what you will want to have in this website. As in layout wise you want to have a game plan for Desktop, mobile and table because all will need a unique design for its specific needs. Now with me having a resturant some pages that wpuld be benificial for me would be HOME, MENU, SPECIALS, ABOUT US, Location, REWARDS, and CONTACT to make sure my customers can get more information about us. Now the reason I choose all these pages is because I want to have the customer click on the website and just be able to room around to get any information they want to know.
